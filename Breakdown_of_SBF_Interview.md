Breakdown of an Interview with Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and Matt Levine

SBF is one of the most important people in crypto. Founder and CEO of FTX, the 2nd largest exchange in the world; and founder of Alameda Research - one of the largest market makers (MM) and hedge funds(HF) in crypto.

[This young WEF superstar](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_AM22_Official_List_of_Participants.pdf) occupies a pivotal position in relation to the CeFi companies which are/nearly bankrupt. FTX operates as a brokerage for loads of these yield/lending ..“products”.. in the crypto world; and hosts Alameda, who acts as a MM and liquidity provider on FTX.

Most western jurisdictions disallow simultaneously operating a brokerage and market maker (due to inherent conflicts of interest in doing so); but Citadel has taught us that this isn't really a problem, so long as there is a veneer of corporate separation between the two.

So with that background lets [start listening to what SBF has to tell us:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMGr4yyE1uc)

> SBF: In fact, some of the names that you've heard about, had accounts on FTX. They had collateral there ... And if they refused to answer a margin call, eventually we deleverage their position.

Many of these big names which promised extremely high yields and are now either bankrupt or very close, apparently were trading with leverage on FTX. So after FTX deleverages the position; presumably, then is Alameda the primary MM / counterparty who assumes beneficial ownership of the collateral?

> Matt: One thing that strikes me is that, their "healthy situation" was like ... 20:1 leverage?
>
> SBF: Right
>
> Matt: Where the liabilities are demand deposits from customers?
>
> SBF: Yep
>
> Matt: And the assets are unsecured loans to fly by night hedge funds, and investments in volatile assets.
>
> SBF: Yep ... yep ...
>
> Matt: Like, what happened? How does that happen?
>
> SBF: Let me describe two different things ... Thing 1 - Lend a billion dollars to 3AC, and take 1.3B of random crap as collateral ...

It would appear that the collateral FTX received from these troubled companies, were customers demand deposits. SBF seems quite aware of the irresponsible leverage being taken by companies promising their customers unrealistic/unsustainable yields. I mean, how could he not be aware of the leverage? Many of these trades are happening on his exchange, and presumably with his MM HF as the counterparty.

Naturally, we might wonder what exactly are they trading? So let's take a look at how SBF describes yield farming, the assets which form them, and their derivatives, as they are a substantial component of the .."products".. brokered and market made by his companies. 

[In their first interview SBF describes farming](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-25/sam-bankman-fried-described-yield-farming-and-left-matt-levine-stunned). [summarized/paraphrased]    
>Take an empty box. It doesn't do anything, except let Eth in/out, and issue Box Token with onchain governance. Box Protocol mints tokens and pays addresses who keep Eth in the box.

He describes how it can gain a massive marketcap based on the social dynamics - People put money into Box Protocol because other people put alot of money into it. Sophisticated investors even, and so more people put even more money in it. And then you can even create lending products based on the protocol (which these troubled companies promising unrealistic/unsustainable yields, participated in).

> Matt: I think of myself as like a fairly cynical person. And that was so much more cynical than how I would've described farming. You're just like, well, I'm in the Ponzi business and it's pretty good.
>
> SBF: So on the one hand, I think that’s a pretty reasonable response, but let me play around with this a little bit. Because that's one framing of this. And I think there's like a sort of depressing amount of validity...

** [Would it be relevant to bring up the *(at least)* $36 billion USDT that Alameda received?](https://cointelegraph.com/news/two-firms-account-for-the-majority-of-tether-received-report). I'm not aware of any direct commentary from SBF on how they spent that USDT. So it leaves us only to speculate whether or not it it’s possible that USDT could pump all the box protocols, which could be used as “reserves” for issuing more USDT, to further pump the box protocols, to issue more USDT, to further pump … You get the idea. 

At a minimum, we can safely say that it requires extreme naivety to skip over this possibility without a second thought.

### Okay we're in deep here, so lets take a moment and take stock of what we've learned thus far

SBF is aware of the ~~shell~~ empty box nature of many of the assets he chose to list on FTX. He was aware that these companies promised unrealistic/unsustainable yields (everyone was). Aware that they took customer demand deposits, placed them on FTX as collateral; and gambled on these empty box assets with high leverage. Presumably, Alameda was a primary counterparty to these trades, taking beneficial ownership of these platforms ~~customer demand deposits~~ collateral margin. 

While I would describe this as unethical and deeply fraudulent; it might be the case that he hasn’t broken any codes or statutes. Or perhaps there is sufficient legally plausible deniability regarding the inferences being made here. That would be for the ~~pharisees~~ lawyers to argue about.

Let's continue.  Timestamp, 20:59
> Matt: So your hedge fund also borrowed from these platforms, is that ordinary course financing positions, is that arbitrage, are you secured?
>
> SBF: There's some variety here. Generally they're decently secured, often they're over-secured ... It's hard to get capital into the crypto ecosystem, there's giant bottlenecks ... So the spigots you do see ... try and get as much as you can through that spigot. And this has been one of the ways capital got into the crypto ecosystem in the first place...

When he says *"try and get as much as you can through that spigot,"* ... that couldn't have anything to do with the crazy high/unrealistic yields being promised to the customers who sent money through that spigot? The same money that went from being customer deposits on (now defunct) lending platforms, to being margin collateral on FTX, and now owned by the counterparties to their liquidated trades. 

> Matt: You say "this", you mean like, retail deposits on these shadow banks?
>
> SBF: Yeah. There's others, there's institutional money there as well.
>
> Matt: And that institution money is funcitonally like, "we're gonna give money to a platform which is going to lend it out as senior claims on crypto-to-crypto hedge funds" ?
>
> SBF: That's basically right, yeah.

In all fairness, it was Matt who used the term "shadow bank," not SBF. Still though, essentially, agreement.

Timestamp 29:15
> Matt: I am curious why people thought running 20:1 leverage worked, and why people let them.
>
> SBF: Yeah, on the "let them," it's not even clear you could tell ***as a customer*** what the leverage was [emphasis added] ...
>
> SBF: The platforms themselves are the only ones who saw their whole books. We sort of got a look at those books after the fact ... But I did not know prior to that, exactly what state each of these places books were actually in.

So I guess all that stuff SBF communicated regarding irresponsible leverage, shell assets, and derivative lending products based on those shell assets, is stuff that he's learned about *recently*, only *after* the bankruptcy of these troubled platforms.

Because if he had known about that stuff, then he wouldn't need to know *exactly, per se*, what the books looked like (for a shadow bank promising unrealistic yields and taking high leverage on shell assets) ... Anyone half educated on finance already knows what those kind of books are basically going to look like.

And if he had known, that might not look so good, in light of spending millions of dollars on Superbowl advert(s).

But okay, since he didn't know exactly (per se) what their books looked like; I'm sure it's just a coincidence then, that some significant percentage of ~~customer demand deposits~~ margin collateral of these shadow banks, is now owned by the MM counterparty (presumably Alameda) to their high leverage trades. Trades made on Sam's brokerage (FTX). 

Timestamp 27:00
[They talk about the May crash as Luna went bust, and the possibility of buying Bitcoin]
> Matt: Did you?!? [buy Bitcoin]. That would've helped.
>
> SBF: It would've. So FTX keeps its treasury in dollars. We did have conversations - at some point we just buy Bitcoins? There was a price. We did not hit that price. But there was a price we would've started to buy Bitcoin.
>
> Matt: And that would've been out of FTX?
>
> SBF: Yeah.

Why backstop the market if your companies are the beneficiary of further margin liquidations?

*\**Note: Even tho SBF never directly confirms; it strains the imagination to think that Alameda would not have been counterparty to some large portion of these leverage trades, seeing as how they're perhpas the largest MM in crypto, and operating of FTX.*

Timestamp 27:55
> Matt: the nice way to put it is that you're being pro-social to the crypto ecosystem ... where you're bailing out depositor facing platforms, you're buying Bitcoin ...

It's even easier to be pro-social and bail out shadow bank platforms when you're in possession of what was formerly their ~~customer demand deposits~~ margin collateral.

> SBF: We came to the question of which needs a bailout more? Bitcoin or depositor facing platforms? And the answer is depositor facing platforms. But you could imagine a slightly different world where the answer is Bitcoin ...

Again, why bail out Bitcoin, if you're the beneficiary of further liquidations? But it's good to know that they're allocating on the basis of ecosystem social need, and not self interest. Very progressive.

Timestamp 28:35
> Matt: Undercollateralized platforms are in the long run supportive of crypto, and you prefer bailing them out?
>
> SBF: Yeah. Getting people back and making sure there aren't customer losses, making sure there isn't contagion spreading through the ecosystem, sort of debt-on-debt-on-debt collapsing ...
>
> SBF: Step 1 is like, stabilize ...

Well, he leaves us with some hope. At least our young WEF superstar is going to make sure that there isn't contagion. That these bankruptcies and restructuring won't permanently take down the entire DeFi / CeFi world. So I'm sure they'll step in and help backstop the market *eventually.*

### TLDR

**These now defunct shadow bank crypto lending platforms were using customer’s demand deposits to place margin collateral onto FTX, in order to take high leverage trades on shell assets. Presumably, Alameda is counterparty to these trades and beneficiary of margin liquidations. And now, in a show of “social responsibility,” Sam appears to be bailing out these shadow banks … with their own money.**

**Whether or not these shell assets were artificially pumped to massive valuations with the $36 billion USDT that Alameda received; and whether or not Sam was innocent of the knowledge of these material factors, is left for the reader to decide.**
